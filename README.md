# Fast Decision Boundary based Out-of-Distribution Detector

This repository contains code for the paper [Fast Decision Boundary based Out-of-Distribution Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11536) (ICML 2024) by Litian Liu and Yao Qin.

In this rudimentary version, we demo the implementation and performance of our algorithm on [OpenOOD Benchmark](https://github.com/Jingkang50/OpenOOD/tree/main). We'll provide our complete code base shortly.
